This unofficial LaTeX package provides a class for creating documents for people working with Nankai University.

This project is based on *huawei – Template for Huawei documents* [[CTAN]](https://ctan.org/pkg/huawei) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/yegor256/huawei.cls).

The user's guide can be found at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alumik/nankai-document/releases).

We recommend you to use `latexmk` to compile your `.tex` files to PDF files.
In order to compile the document, just say `latexmk -pdf` on the command line.

Disclaimer: This is **NOT** a product of Nankai University. This package is created to help some people render documents in LATEX format. You are welcome to use it at your own risk.
